This module enables real-time adjustment of trade amounts during runtime.  
All changes are written directly into the configuration JSON and reflected immediately in the trading loop.

- **Standard Trade Amount** – Base trade size  
- **Minimum / Maximum** – Dynamic bounds for randomization  
- **Save & Apply** – Writes new values without stopping active threads  

---

## ⚖️ Live Buy/Sell Ratio

![Buy/Sell Ratio](Ratiobuy.JPG)

This interface allows live modification of the market behavior:
- **Buy Probability (0 – 1)** directly changes trade direction tendency.  
- Real-time adjustments influence the next execution cycles instantly.  
- Supports both manual control and automated re-balancing through the target stabilization system.

---

## 🚦 Trade Rate Limiter

![Trade Rate Limiter](rate%20LimiterJPG.JPG)

A core safety system that prevents over-trading and simulates natural market rhythm.

| Setting | Function |
|----------|-----------|
| **Enable Rate Limiter** | Activates trade pacing control globally. |
| **Max Trades / Minute** | Defines the upper limit of allowed executions. |
| **Min Interval Between Trades** | Global cooldown (seconds) shared across all wallets. |
| **Organic Trading (Auto-Distribute Evenly)** | Randomizes trade delays using internal λ₁/λ₂ functions to emulate human timing. |

---

## 🎯 Target Price Stabilization

![Target Stabilization Active](target%20stabilization.JPG)

This module continuously monitors on-chain prices and balances the buy/sell ratio  
to maintain the desired target value within a tolerance corridor.

- **Target USD Price** – Price goal in USD  
- **Tolerance (%)** – Acceptable deviation range  
- **Active Status** – Displays mode, ratio, and live range limits  

When enabled, the bot self-adjusts:
if current_price < target - tolerance → increase Buy ratio
if current_price > target + tolerance → increase Sell ratio

## 🪙 Token & Pool Creation

![Token Creation](token%20pool%20creation.JPG)

Instantly deploy new tokens and initialize liquidity pools directly from the GUI.

- **Token Name / Symbol / Supply** — basic ERC-20 parameters  
- **Optional Pool Creation** — automatic pairing with ETH after deployment  
- **Create Token** — deploys the smart contract and registers it in the system configuration  

---

## 📜 Event Log & Market Visualization

![Event Log](event%20log.JPG)

The log panel records every execution and system message in real time:
- Price updates, nonce checks, and transaction results  
- Target enable/disable events  
- Thread lifecycle management (PID tracking)

---

## 📊 Real-Time Chart Example

![Live Market Chart](chart1.JPG)

Charts illustrate how the stabilization engine interacts with the market.  
Candlestick and volume data reflect organic trading distribution and ratio-based control.

---

## 🧠 Algorithmic Foundation

The trading engine combines deterministic logic with probabilistic modeling:
λ₁ = trade_interval_random(min,max)
λ₂ = adaptive_delay(fee_pressure, gas_limit)

P(buy) = ratio * (1 - λ₁)
P(sell) = (1 - ratio) * λ₂

A simplified **Bellman–Ford** pathfinding adaptation ensures optimal transaction timing across multiple wallets  
to simulate realistic, human-like trading behavior without direct arbitrage objectives.

## 🧩 System Sentinel: The Role of the Rate Limiter

The **Rate Limiter** in Dr. Einhorn is not just a safety switch — it acts as a **sentinel layer**  
between the trading threads and the blockchain execution queue.

While each bot instance runs independently, generating buy/sell orders according to the ratio logic,  
the **sentinel** intercepts and evaluates every pending trade request before it is submitted on-chain.

### 🧠 Functional Overview
- The limiter **does not stop the bots** — they continue to run, collect data, and generate signals.
- Instead, it **filters** which trades are actually allowed to pass based on:
  - The current **max trades per minute**,
  - The **minimum interval** between all trades (global cooldown),
  - And the current **buy/sell ratio state**.
- When the limit is reached, subsequent trades are **temporarily delayed** rather than canceled.
  This keeps the internal statistics coherent and prevents artificial volume spikes.

### 🎯 Core Purpose
By controlling transaction throughput without pausing execution,  
the Rate Limiter ensures:
1. **Ratio Stability** – maintains a consistent buy/sell distribution even under heavy load.  
2. **Organic Flow** – trades appear human and evenly spaced across wallets.  
3. **Gas Efficiency** – redundant or spammy transactions are automatically throttled.

In essence, the sentinel serves as the **rhythm keeper** of the entire system —  
letting the bots "think" freely while ensuring that only the right trades reach the network at the right time.

## 🛰️ Pool Monitor & Reaction System

The **Pool Monitor** acts as a continuous guardian process, analyzing every swap and liquidity event in real time.  
It is directly connected to the blockchain via RPC/WebSocket and reacts instantly to external activity in the tracked pool.

### 🔍 Core Behavior

The monitor continuously checks:
- Incoming and outgoing swaps  
- LP (liquidity pool) changes  
- External wallet interactions  
- Unusual gas or timing patterns (potential sniper bot behavior)

Depending on the **active mode**, the reaction differs:

---

### 🚀 Pump Mode (Buy-Only Protection)
When operating in **Pump Mode**, the monitor functions as an emergency defense system.  
If an external sniper bot or high-frequency buy is detected:

- The monitor **immediately triggers pool liquidation** (removes all liquidity).  
- **All bot processes are terminated instantly.**  
- This ensures **no further trades can be executed**, effectively freezing the market.  
- Purpose: protect the project and liquidity from sniper exploitation during critical early phases.

---

### ⚖️ Normal Mode (Balanced Trading)
In **Normal Mode**, the monitor behaves passively but remains active in the background.

- On suspicious or external trade detection, it **stops the internal bot execution** safely.  
- The **GUI remains active**, allowing manual inspection and quick restart.  
- This ensures stability without losing analytics or monitoring visibility.  

---

### 🔒 Dump Mode (Sell-Only)
In **Dump Mode**, the monitor is **inactive** — it does not intervene with pool or bot processes.  
This mode is typically used for controlled liquidity exits or stress tests.

---

### 🧠 Purpose
The monitor creates a protective perimeter around automated trading logic.  
By dynamically halting, isolating, or shutting down processes based on context,  
it prevents unwanted interference while keeping the system transparent and under full user control.

---

---

## 🎯 Price Stabilization Engine

The **Price Stabilization Engine** is the core intelligence layer of the Dr. Einhorn trading system.  
It continuously analyzes live market data, calculates price deviations,  
and dynamically adjusts the internal **buy/sell ratio** to keep the asset price within a defined range.

---

### 🧮 Core Concept

The engine operates on two key parameters:
- **Target Price (USD)** — the ideal market value to maintain.  
- **Tolerance (%)** — the allowed deviation range above or below the target.

It runs as an autonomous process that constantly compares the **current price**  
against the **target corridor**:

lower_bound = target_price * (1 - tolerance/100)
upper_bound = target_price * (1 + tolerance/100)

Whenever the live price moves outside this range, the bot automatically adapts  
its **trading behavior** to counterbalance the shift.

---

### ⚖️ Dynamic Ratio Adjustment

The stabilization engine directly manipulates the **Buy/Sell Ratio**:

| Condition | Action | Example Ratio |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Price below lower bound | Increase buy pressure | 0.8 (80% buy / 20% sell) |
| Price above upper bound | Increase sell pressure | 0.2 (20% buy / 80% sell) |
| Price within range | Maintain balanced mode | 0.5 (50% / 50%) |

This adjustment occurs in real time without restarting the bot —  
the ratio value is updated and applied to all active trading threads instantly.

---

### 🤖 Detection & Response Logic

The system uses a lightweight detection algorithm that monitors:
- Continuous on-chain swaps  
- Average price movement (EMA/SMA logic)  
- Trade impact relative to pool liquidity  

Based on these signals, it chooses the optimal **probability ratio**  
that statistically drives the price back toward the target range.

---

### 🧠 Functional Summary
- Fully automatic — no manual input required after activation  
- Works in all active modes (Pump, Dump, Normal)  
- Adjusts ratio instantly and independently for every running thread  
- Maintains long-term stability without freezing liquidity or volume

In simple terms, the stabilization engine is the **brain** of Dr. Einhorn:  
it *recognizes* price shifts and *responds* by self-balancing market behavior  
through real-time ratio correction — keeping the market both active and under control.
