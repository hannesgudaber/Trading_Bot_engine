# ⚙️ Core Algorithms & Trading Logic

This section describes the internal mechanisms and logic behind the **Dr. Einhorn Trading & Analysis Software**.  
All parameters, limits, and runtime behaviors can be adjusted in real time through dedicated control panels.

---

## 🧩 Trading Bot Configuration

![Trading Bot Configuration](bot%20config.JPG)

The configuration module defines the bot’s runtime, trading amount, and operational behavior.

### Key Parameters
| Setting | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Trading Mode** | Choose between **Pump (Buy Only)**, **Dump (Sell Only)**, or **Normal (Buy & Sell)** modes. |
| **Runtime (Minutes)** | Total session duration before automatic shutdown. |
| **Trade Amount (ETH)** | Standard value used for each buy/sell action. |
| **Min / Max Trade Amount (ETH)** | Defines the dynamic lower and upper range for trade amounts. |
| **Max Threads** | Number of parallel worker instances for multi-wallet trading. |
| **Sell-on-Buy** | Optional reactive selling mechanism triggered after a buy event within a given time window. |
| **Buy/Sell Ratio** | Sets probability distribution (0 = Sell Only, 0.5 = Balanced, 1 = Buy Only). |
| **Pool Selection** | Automatic pool detection or manual selection for advanced users. |

---

## 📉 Live Trade Amounts

![Live Trade Amounts](livetradeamm.JPG)

This module enables real-time adjustment of trade amounts during runtime.  
All changes are written directly into the configuration JSON and reflected immediately in the trading loop.

- **Standard Trade Amount** – Base trade size  
- **Minimum / Maximum** – Dynamic bounds for randomization  
- **Save & Apply** – Writes new values without stopping active threads  

---

## ⚖️ Live Buy/Sell Ratio

![Buy/Sell Ratio](Ratiobuy.JPG)

This interface allows live modification of the market behavior:
- **Buy Probability (0 – 1)** directly changes trade direction tendency.  
- Real-time adjustments influence the next execution cycles instantly.  
- Supports both manual control and automated re-balancing through the target stabilization system.

---

## 🚦 Trade Rate Limiter

![Trade Rate Limiter](rate%20LimiterJPG.JPG)

A core safety system that prevents over-trading and simulates natural market rhythm.

| Setting | Function |
|----------|-----------|
| **Enable Rate Limiter** | Activates trade pacing control globally. |
| **Max Trades / Minute** | Defines the upper limit of allowed executions. |
| **Min Interval Between Trades** | Global cooldown (seconds) shared across all wallets. |
| **Organic Trading (Auto-Distribute Evenly)** | Randomizes trade delays using internal λ₁/λ₂ functions to emulate human timing. |

---

## 🎯 Target Price Stabilization

![Target Stabilization Active](target%20stabilization.JPG)

This module continuously monitors on-chain prices and balances the buy/sell ratio  
to maintain the desired target value within a tolerance corridor.

- **Target USD Price** – Price goal in USD  
- **Tolerance (%)** – Acceptable deviation range  
- **Active Status** – Displays mode, ratio, and live range limits  

When enabled, the bot self-adjusts:
if current_price < target - tolerance → increase Buy ratio
if current_price > target + tolerance → increase Sell ratio

## 🪙 Token & Pool Creation

![Token Creation](token%20pool%20creation.JPG)

Instantly deploy new tokens and initialize liquidity pools directly from the GUI.

- **Token Name / Symbol / Supply** — basic ERC-20 parameters  
- **Optional Pool Creation** — automatic pairing with ETH after deployment  
- **Create Token** — deploys the smart contract and registers it in the system configuration  

---

## 📜 Event Log & Market Visualization

![Event Log](event%20log.JPG)

The log panel records every execution and system message in real time:
- Price updates, nonce checks, and transaction results  
- Target enable/disable events  
- Thread lifecycle management (PID tracking)

---

## 📊 Real-Time Chart Example

![Live Market Chart](chart1.JPG)

Charts illustrate how the stabilization engine interacts with the market.  
Candlestick and volume data reflect organic trading distribution and ratio-based control.

---

## 🧠 Algorithmic Foundation

The trading engine combines deterministic logic with probabilistic modeling:
λ₁ = trade_interval_random(min,max)
λ₂ = adaptive_delay(fee_pressure, gas_limit)

P(buy) = ratio * (1 - λ₁)
P(sell) = (1 - ratio) * λ₂

A simplified **Bellman–Ford** pathfinding adaptation ensures optimal transaction timing across multiple wallets  
to simulate realistic, human-like trading behavior without direct arbitrage objectives.

## 🧩 System Sentinel: The Role of the Rate Limiter

The **Rate Limiter** in Dr. Einhorn is not just a safety switch — it acts as a **sentinel layer**  
between the trading threads and the blockchain execution queue.

While each bot instance runs independently, generating buy/sell orders according to the ratio logic,  
the **sentinel** intercepts and evaluates every pending trade request before it is submitted on-chain.

### 🧠 Functional Overview
- The limiter **does not stop the bots** — they continue to run, collect data, and generate signals.
- Instead, it **filters** which trades are actually allowed to pass based on:
  - The current **max trades per minute**,
  - The **minimum interval** between all trades (global cooldown),
  - And the current **buy/sell ratio state**.
- When the limit is reached, subsequent trades are **temporarily delayed** rather than canceled.
  This keeps the internal statistics coherent and prevents artificial volume spikes.

### 🎯 Core Purpose
By controlling transaction throughput without pausing execution,  
the Rate Limiter ensures:
1. **Ratio Stability** – maintains a consistent buy/sell distribution even under heavy load.  
2. **Organic Flow** – trades appear human and evenly spaced across wallets.  
3. **Gas Efficiency** – redundant or spammy transactions are automatically throttled.

In essence, the sentinel serves as the **rhythm keeper** of the entire system —  
letting the bots "think" freely while ensuring that only the right trades reach the network at the right time.

## 🛰️ Pool Monitor & Reaction System

The **Pool Monitor** acts as a continuous guardian process, analyzing every swap and liquidity event in real time.  
It is directly connected to the blockchain via RPC/WebSocket and reacts instantly to external activity in the tracked pool.

### 🔍 Core Behavior

The monitor continuously checks:
- Incoming and outgoing swaps  
- LP (liquidity pool) changes  
- External wallet interactions  
- Unusual gas or timing patterns (potential sniper bot behavior)

Depending on the **active mode**, the reaction differs:

---

### 🚀 Pump Mode (Buy-Only Protection)
When operating in **Pump Mode**, the monitor functions as an emergency defense system.  
If an external sniper bot or high-frequency buy is detected:

- The monitor **immediately triggers pool liquidation** (removes all liquidity).  
- **All bot processes are terminated instantly.**  
- This ensures **no further trades can be executed**, effectively freezing the market.  
- Purpose: protect the project and liquidity from sniper exploitation during critical early phases.

---

### ⚖️ Normal Mode (Balanced Trading)
In **Normal Mode**, the monitor behaves passively but remains active in the background.

- On suspicious or external trade detection, it **stops the internal bot execution** safely.  
- The **GUI remains active**, allowing manual inspection and quick restart.  
- This ensures stability without losing analytics or monitoring visibility.  

---

### 🔒 Dump Mode (Sell-Only)
In **Dump Mode**, the monitor is **inactive** — it does not intervene with pool or bot processes.  
This mode is typically used for controlled liquidity exits or stress tests.

---

### 🧠 Purpose
The monitor creates a protective perimeter around automated trading logic.  
By dynamically halting, isolating, or shutting down processes based on context,  
it prevents unwanted interference while keeping the system transparent and under full user control.
